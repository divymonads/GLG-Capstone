## GLG Topic Modelling

### Gerson Lehrman Group sponsored project on NLP

Team Members: Surnjani Djoko, Divy Gandhi, Prithvi Nuthanakalva

Description:
Given an article of text, this application will return a distribution of probabilities of what topic it could be and a subject matter expert associated with the topic.

It also does metadata tagging through Named Entity Recognition.

Essentially, this is a light weight UI that fronts a fine-tuned BERT model for NER and a custom LDA model that was trained on 2.2 million articles.

Basic Components:
- Web app in streamlit for UI
- Flask container for LDA model (LDA Multicore using gensim)
- Flask container for NER model (Fine-tuned BERT model)

Both of the model containers were deployed to Sagemaker.
